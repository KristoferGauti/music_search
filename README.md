#Module installation
To install the music-search, you go to Extend, and there you should see
the module music-search under Custom. When the module is installed, the landing page
for the search is at /radio_buttons_form. There you can choose:
- search for artist
- search for album
- search for track

This makes it so that the queries to either the Spotify API, or the Discogs API are a lot more excact.
From there on you can type what it is that you are searching for.
When the search is made, it will lead you to the search-results page, where you can narrow down the
data that is supposed to go in the database. After you have narrowed it down,
you will get a list of the marked data, and you can choose from there what data you want from which service (spotify or discogs).
After you have confirmed the data that is supposed to be inserted into the database
, the data goes through validation and if everything matches, the data is inserted.
We did not complete the artist insertion, because of time limiations.
